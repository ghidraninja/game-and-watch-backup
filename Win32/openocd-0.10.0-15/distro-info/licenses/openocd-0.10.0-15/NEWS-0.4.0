This file includes highlights of the changes made in the
OpenOCD 0.4.0 source archive release.  See the repository
history for details about what changed, including bugfixes
and other issues not mentioned here.

JTAG Layer:
	Support KT-Link JTAG adapter.
	Support USB-JTAG, Altera USB-Blaster and compatibles.

Boundary Scan:

Target Layer:
	General
		- Removed commands which have been obsolete for at least
		  a year (from both documentation and, sometimes, code).
		- new "reset-assert" event, for systems without SRST
	ARM
		- supports "reset-assert" event (except on Cortex-M3)
		- renamed "armv4_5" command prefix as "arm"
		- recognize TrustZone "Secure Monitor" mode
		- "arm regs" command output changed
		- register names use "sp" not "r13"
		- add top-level "mcr" and "mrc" commands, replacing
		  various core-specific operations
		- basic semihosting support (ARM7/ARM9 only, for now)
	ARM11
		- Should act much more like other ARM cores:
		   * Preliminary ETM and ETB hookup
		   * accelerated "flash erase_check"
		   * accelerated GDB memory checksum
		   * support "arm regs" command
		   * can access all core modes and registers
		   * watchpoint support
		- Shares some core debug code with Cortex-A8
	Cortex-A8
		- Should act much more like other ARM cores:
		   * support "arm regs" command
		   * can access all core modes and registers
		   * watchpoint support
		- Shares some core debug code with ARM11
	Cortex-M3
		- Exposed DWT registers like cycle counter
		- vector_catch settings not clobbered by resets
		- no longer interferes with firmware's fault handling
	ETM, ETB
		- "trigger_percent" command moved ETM --> ETB
		- "etm trigger_debug" command added
	MIPS
		- use fastdata writes
	Freescale DSP563xx cores (partial support)

Flash Layer:
	'flash bank' and 'nand device' take <bank_name> as first argument.
	With this, flash/NAND commands allow referencing banks by name:
		- <bank_name>: reference the bank with its defined name
		- <driver_name>[.N]: reference the driver's Nth bank
	New 'nand verify' command to check bank against an image file.
	The "flash erase_address" command now rejects partial sectors;
		previously it would silently erase extra data.  If you
		want to erase the rest of the first and/or last sectors
		instead of failing, you must pass an explicit "pad" flag.
	New at91sam9 NAND controller driver.
	New s3c64xx NAND controller driver.

Board, Target, and Interface Configuration Scripts:
	ARM9
		- ETM and ETB hookup for iMX2* targets
	Add $HOME/.openocd to the search path.
	Handle Rev C of LM3S811 eval boards.
		- use "luminary-lm3s811.cfg" for older boards
		- use "luminary.cfg" for RevC and newer

Core Jim/TCL Scripting:
	New 'usage' command to provide terse command help.
	Improved command 'help' command output (sorted and indented).
	Improved command handling:
		- Most boolean settings now accept any of the following:
		  on/off, enable/disable, true/false, yes/no, 1/0
		- More error checking and reporting.

Documentation:
	New built-in command development documentation and primer.

Build and Release:
	Use --enable-doxygen-pdf to build PDF developer documentation.
	Consider upgrading to libftdi 0.17 if you use that library; it
		includes bugfixes which improve FT2232H support.
