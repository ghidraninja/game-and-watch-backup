This file should include highlights of the changes made in the
OpenOCD openocd-0.3.0 source archive release.  See the repository
history for details about what changed, including bugfixes and
other issues not mentioned here.

JTAG Layer:
    FT2232H (high speed USB) support doesn't need separate configuration
    New FT2232H JTAG adapters:  Amontec, Olimex, Signalyzer
    New reset_config options for SRST gating the JTAG clock (or not)
    TAP declaration no longer requires ircapture and mask attributes
    Scan chain setup should be more robust, with better diagnostics
    New TAP events:
	"post-reset" for TAP-invariant setup code (TAPs not usable yet)
	"setup" for use once TAPs are addressable (e.g. with ICEpick)
    Overridable Tcl "init_reset" and "jtag_init" procedures
    Simple "autoprobe" mechanism to help simplify server setup

Boundary Scan:
    SVF bugfixes ... parsing fixes, better STATE switch conformance
    XSVF bugfixes ... be more correct, handle Xilinx tool output

Target Layer:
    Warn on use of obsolete numeric target IDs
    New commands for use with Cortex-M3 processors:
	"cortex_m3 disassemble" ... Thumb2 disassembly (UAL format)
	"cortex_m3 vector_catch" ... traps certain hardware faults
		without tying up breakpoint resources
    If you're willing to help debug it
	VERY EARLY Cortex-A8 and ARMv7A support
	Updated BeagleBoard.org hardware support
	you may need to explicitly "reset" after connect-to-Beagle
    New commands for use with XScale processors: "xscale vector_table"
    ARM
	bugfixes to single-stepping Thumb code
	ETM: unavailable registers are not listed
	ETB, ETM: report actual hardware status
    ARM9
	name change:  "arm9 vector_catch" not "arm9tdmi vector_catch"
    ARM11
	single stepping support for i.MX31
	bugfix for missing "arm11" prefix on "arm11 memwrite ..."
    GDB support
	gdb_attach command is gone

Flash Layer:
    The lpc2000 driver handles the new NXP LPC1700 (Cortex-M3) chips
    New drivers:
	lpc2900, for NXP LPC2900 chips (ARM968 based)
	mx3_nand, for imx31
    New "last" flag for NOR "flash erase_sector" and "flash protect"
    The "nand erase N" command now erases all of bank N
    Speed up davinci_nand by about 3x

Board, Target, and Interface Configuration Scripts:
    Amontec JTAGkey2 support
    Cleanup and additions for the TI/Luminary Stellaris scripts
    LPC1768 target (and flash) support
	Keil MCB1700 eval board
    Samsung s3c2450
	Mini2440 board
    Numeric TAP and Target identifiers now trigger warnings
    PXA255 partially enumerates

Documentation:
    Capture more debugging and setup advice
    Notes on target source code changes that may help debugging

Build and Release:
    Repository moved from SVN at Berlios to GIT at SourceForge
    Clean builds on (32-bit) Cygwin
    Clean builds on 64-bit MinGW
