This code is an example of using the openocd debug message system.

Before the message output is seen in the debug window, the functionality
will need enabling:

From the gdb prompt:
monitor target_request debugmsgs enable
monitor trace point 1

From the Telnet prompt:
target_request debugmsgs enable
trace point 1

To see how many times the trace point was hit:
(monitor) trace point 1
